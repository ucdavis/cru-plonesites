A CLOSER LOOK
<br>
Inside View
<br>
During winter break, a dozen students from the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences got an insider’s view of agriculture while on a
<br>
three-day tour of farms, nurseries, and related operations in Southern California
<br>
and Arizona. UC Davis undergraduates joined students majoring in science,
<br>
technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from other universities on a
<br>
trip organized by the Western Growers Association. The tour covered automa-
<br>
tion, irrigation, labor, food safety, and more. While on the tour, students connect-
<br>
ed with professionals in the agriculture industry and learned about the many
<br>
career opportunities available in the field. View additional photos at
