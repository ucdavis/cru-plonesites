                        <h2> Honor Your Mom, Help Save a Life</h2>

                        <p>
                            Mother&#39;s Day is right around the corner and although we should be celebrating our moms year-round, it&#39;s nice to take a moment to make this Sunday extra special. While you might be showering your mother with gifts, flowers, and maybe even breakfast in bed, we have an idea that will get you extra brownie points…
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What better gift is there than saving a life on behalf of your mom for Mother&#39;s Day? Don&#39;t panic &ndash; we can&#39;t all be superheroes at the drop of a hat, but I have a solution that will make you a superhero in the eyes of many children in sub-Saharan Africa&ndash;sending a bednet with Nothing But Nets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A simple $10 donation sends a bednet to a family in sub-Saharan Africa to help protect them from malaria. For mothers like Zabay, malaria is a constant worry. &ldquo;Malaria is the biggest health problem for my family.&rdquo; She told Margaret Reilly McDonnell, Deputy Director of Nothing But Nets. Luckily, Zabay received a net for her family last year. &ldquo;I&#39;m happy especially for my [older] child, she didn&#39;t get sick in the last two years,&rdquo; she said.

                            In observance of World Malaria Day, today thousands of supporters worldwide will join The Million Nets Pledge, our two-year pledge to protect refugee families with one million bednets by 2016. This ambitious $10 million pledge focuses on our increased work with UN partners to protect children, refugees, and families displaced by conflict in sub-Saharan Africa from malaria.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There has been a large surge in refugee families displaced by conflict in several countries across Africa. Malaria is a leading killer of refugees &ndash; after all they have endured and survived, these families should not have to fear dying from a mosquito bite.

                            The Southern California Chapter of the Association of Nigerian Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) is proud to collaborate with Nothing but Nets in the global effort to eradicate malaria. Malaria is plain and simple, a sadistic killer. It tortures its victims, 10 days to 4 weeks (sometimes up to one year) after the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Victims experience recurrent bouts of high fever, chills, rigors, profuse sweating, nausea and vomiting, and then in some victims, it takes their life. Every 60 seconds a child dies from malaria.

                            Recently, the White House hosted the U.S. President&#39;s Malaria Initiative (PMI) and Nothing But Nets to celebrate 10 years of U.S. leadership in the fight against malaria. The event convened global malaria leaders and included Nothing But Nets Champion and NBA star Stephen Curry.

                            At the event, PMI unveiled its new six-year malaria strategy. This is an important read, but if you don’t have time to go through it, here are five key things you should know:
